# HealthPro: Smart Disease predictor
- This Machine Learning project predicts the disease based on the symptoms given by the user.
- It predicts using three different machine learning algorithms.
    1. Decision Tree
    2. Random Forest
    3. Naive Baye's
- The application comes with a GUI developed using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
- The Training and testing files have also been provided to try out other models on the dataset.
- The trained models should be in the same folder as the main_gui.py file.

# Requirements
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Instruction to run the code:
```sh
python main_gui.py
```
